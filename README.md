## Overview

## Motivation
One of my goals for 2021 was to pick up a language that I had always wanted to learn-- Japanese. I figured the best time was probably 10 years ago, so the second best time was now. In the early stages of learning this new language, I was wondering if there was a way to combine my interest in programming and machine learning with learning Japanese. I was learning hiragana at that time (one of the components of the Japanese writing system) and haven't ran into something that was able to recognize only handwritten hiragana. I'm sure if I dug harder I would find something similar but figure this would be a fun little project on the side and my ability to recall writing newly learned hiragana.
